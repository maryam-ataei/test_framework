This folder contains CSV input files for testing the following HyStart
implementations:

  • HyStart++  
  • HyStart (kernel 5.10)  
  • HyStart (kernel 6.13)  

All CSV inputs captured from the Linux TCP CUBIC
implementation with HyStart enabled on kernel version 6.13.
This ensures that every congestion control variant receives identical
input conditions, allowing fair and consistent comparison.

For additional validation, the folder `verification_csv` contains
corresponding kernel-level logs. These can be used to cross-check results
produced by your test framework and confirm correctness of cwnd, RTT,
and loss-related behaviors.


This dataset can be used both to validate the test framework’s correctness
for HyStart (kernel 6.13) and to compare the behavior across different HyStart
kernel versions—HyStart (5.10), HyStart (6.13), and HyStart++. 
In particular, it enables consistent evaluation of key metrics such as cwnd growth
and exit timing, with kernel 6.13 serving as the reference baseline.
