This folder contains sample CSV data captured from the Linux TCP CUBIC
implementation with HyStart enabled on kernel version 6.13.

This folder contains CSV input files for testing the following HyStart
implementations:

  • HyStart++  
  • HyStart (kernel 5.10)  
  • HyStart (kernel 6.13)  

For additional validation, the folder `verification_csv` contains
corresponding kernel-level logs. These can be used to cross-check results
produced by your test framework.
