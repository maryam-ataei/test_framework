This folder contains sample CSV data captured from the Linux TCP CUBIC
implementation with HyStart enabled on kernel version 6.13.

These CSV traces include two additional columns at the end of each row:
  - snd_cwnd
  - snd_ssthresh

These extra fields allow direct verification of HyStart++ behavior and
enable comparison with the previous HyStart algorithm in kernel 6.13.
