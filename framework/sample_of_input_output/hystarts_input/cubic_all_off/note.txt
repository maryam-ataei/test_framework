This folder contains CSV input files for testing the following HyStart
implementations:

  • HyStart++  
  • HyStart (kernel 5.10)  
  • HyStart (kernel 6.13)  

All CSV inputs were taken while using `tcp_cubic.c` with 
**HyStart disabled** on Linux kernel 6.13.
This ensures that every congestion control variant receives identical
input conditions, allowing fair and consistent comparison.

For additional validation, the folder `verification_csv` contains
corresponding kernel-level logs. These can be used to cross-check results
produced by your test framework and confirm correctness of cwnd, RTT,
and loss-related behaviors.
